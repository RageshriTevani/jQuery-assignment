What is jQuery?
<!--
    jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. 
    
    It simplifies various tasks in web development such as HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and AJAX interactions. 
    
    jQuery allows developers to write shorter and more concise code compared to traditional JavaScript, making it easier to create interactive and dynamic web pages. 
    
    It was developed by John Resig and released in 2006. While it has been widely used in the past, with the advancement of modern web technologies and native browser features, its usage has declined somewhat, but it still remains relevant in certain contexts.

How to Apply CSS Using JQuery, How to Add Class and Remove Class in Jquery, JQuery Animation?
<!--
    Sure, here's a brief overview of how to accomplish these tasks using jQuery:

    Applying CSS using jQuery:

    You can use the `css()` method in jQuery to apply CSS styles to elements. Here's an example:


    // Set the background color of all paragraphs to re
    $("p").css("background-color", "red");


    Adding and Removing Classes in jQuery:

    You can use the `addClass()` and `removeClass()` methods to add and remove classes from elements, respectively. Here's an example:


    // Add the "active" class to all elements with the class "menu-item"
    $(".menu-item").addClass("active");


    // Remove the "active" class from all elements with the class "menu-item"

    $(".menu-item").removeClass("active");

    jQuery Animation:

    jQuery provides several methods for creating animations, such as `fadeIn()`, `fadeOut()`, `slideUp()`, `slideDown()`, `animate()`, etc. These methods allow you to animate the changes in CSS properties over a specified duration. Here's an example:

    // Fade in an element over 1 second
    $("#myElement").fadeIn(1000);

    // Slide up an element over 500 milliseconds
    $(".myElement").slideUp(500);

    // Custom animation using animate()
    $("#myElement").animate({
    opacity: 0.5,
    left: "50px",
    fontSize: "20px"
    }, 1000);


    These are just basic examples to get you started. jQuery provides many more methods and options for CSS manipulation and animation, so feel free to explore the documentation for more advanced usage.
